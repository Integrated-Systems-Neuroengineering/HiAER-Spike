# Welcome to HiAER-Spike v0.1.0

HiAER-Spike (**Hi**erarchical **A**ddress-**E**vent **R**outing of spikes) is a python library designed to interact with the ISN CRI project hosted on the [San Diego Supercomputer (SDSC)](https://www.sdsc.edu/). The goal of this project is to streamline access to large-scale simulations of spiking neural networks for the research community. It primarily targets researchers with a focus on neuromorphic computing within the fields of artificial intelligence and neuroscience. With HiAER-Spike, a user can design a spiking neural network and run it using one of two backends: 

  - the CRI neuromorphic hardware or 
  - a python simulation of the hardware
